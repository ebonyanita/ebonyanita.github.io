  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am a PhD Candidate in Economics, working as a research and teaching associate at the Institute of Markets and Strategy, Vienna University of Economics and Business. I'm supervised by Ben Greiner. My research focuses on cooperation in the provision of multiple public goods, environmental economics, and game theory.</p>
  <p>Previously, I was a university assistant at the University of Graz working with Prof. Michael Finus. I hold an MSc in Economics (Science Track) from WU Vienna and a Bachelor of Economics from the University of Queensland.</p>
  <p>When I'm not in the office I can be found playing Pokémon with my son, roaming around taking photographs, or avoiding the folding of laundry. </p>
